# Data Directory

This directory contains sample data and language resources for the Turkic Transliteration package.

## Contents

- `kk_ipa.txt` - Kazakh text transliterated to IPA format
- `kk_latin.txt` - Kazakh text transliterated to Latin format
- `samples/` - Directory containing sample text files
  - `sample_kk.txt` - Sample Kazakh text in Cyrillic script

## Using These Files

These files can be used for testing and demonstration purposes. The examples in the `examples/` directory often use these files to showcase the transliteration functionality.

## Adding New Data

When adding new data files:

1. Use descriptive names with appropriate language prefixes (`kk_` for Kazakh, `ky_` for Kyrgyz, etc.)
2. Place sample texts in the `samples/` directory
3. Place processed or transliterated files in the main data directory
4. Use UTF-8 encoding for all text files
