# Turkic Transliteration Examples

This directory contains various demonstration scripts and applications showing how to use the Turkic Transliteration package.

## Simple CLI Examples

- `simple_demo.py` - A minimal demonstration of basic transliteration capabilities
- `demo_translit.py` - A more comprehensive demonstration with multiple languages

## Web Interface

The `web/` directory contains a full-featured web application for exploring transliteration functionality:

- `web_demo.py` - The core UI implementation using Gradio
- `app.py` - A simple entry point for launching the web application

### Running the Web UI

To run the web interface, execute:

```bash
cd examples/web
python app.py
```

This will launch a web server on port 7860 that you can access in your browser.
