"""Kyrgyz transliteration checked against the description the rules cite.

McCollum 2020 is a research article rather than an Illustration, so it
carries no keyword chart. What it does carry is Table 1 (the consonant
inventory), Table 2 (the vowel inventory) and Table 3, which gives eight
roots in IPA alongside their suffixed forms. Those eight are the
expectations here, written as the article prints them.

An earlier version of this file cited a Wikipedia page rather than the
article the rule file names, which is why a mismatch in <ж> went
unnoticed for so long: the rules gave the letter its Russian value, a
fricative, where Table 3 prints the affricate in both roots it supplies.
Nothing internal could catch that, because the fricative is a real Kyrgyz
phoneme and so passes an inventory check; only the source settles it.
