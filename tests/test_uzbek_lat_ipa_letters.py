"""Uzbek transliteration checked against the description the rules cite.

Ido prints the Latin orthography beside each transcription, so nothing is
inferred about the spelling. All twenty-three keywords match once six
declared deviations are applied: five are notation, and one is a
difference in how a rhotic is written.

Both this file and the Cyrillic one draw on the same Illustration, since
the two rule sets transcribe the same language in its two alphabets.
