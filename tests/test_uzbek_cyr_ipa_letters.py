"""Cyrillic Uzbek checked against the same description as the Latin rules.

Ido prints the Latin orthography, so the Cyrillic spellings here are the
standard correspondences of those same words. That inference is not
taken on trust: a wrong spelling produces a different transcription and
fails, which is how the affricate defect below was found.

The deviations are the same six the Latin file declares, since the two
rule sets transcribe one language in its two alphabets and must agree.
