"""Finnish transliteration checked against the description the rules cite.

Suomi, Toivanen and Ylitalo devote a chapter to the relationship between
sound structure and orthography, so unlike the JIPA Illustrations this
source states grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences directly rather than
only printing keywords. Three kinds of evidence are used here, all of
them printed in the book:

* the quantity series on p. 19, where each orthographic form is given
  with its phonemic transcription;
* the series of eight word forms on p. 20 that runs through the eight
  vowel phonemes in order;
* the velar nasal, which p. 141 calls the one fully systematic exception
  to the one-grapheme-one-phoneme principle, together with the two words
  the phonotactics chapter transcribes in brackets on pp. 57-58.

The book writes a long segment as a sequence of two identical phonemes
and marks the dental place on the coronal plosives; these rules use the
length mark and leave the place unmarked. Both differences are declared
below and applied to the published transcription before comparison, so
that what is compared is the same claim in two notations.
