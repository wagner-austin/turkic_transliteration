"""Kazakh transliteration checked against the description the rules cite.

McCollum & Chen print the Cyrillic beside each transcription, so nothing
has to be inferred about the orthography: the expectations below are
their values, at the page they appear on. The rule file declares that it
drops the dental diacritics and the diphthongs, and those two
simplifications are applied to the published form here rather than being
folded into hand-edited constants, so the difference stays visible.

The previous version of this file described itself as a gold standard
"synchronised with" the paper while its rows had been edited to match the
rules, and annotated the edits with notes like "was d̪". That records the
divergence in a comment instead of in an assertion. Applying the declared
simplification explicitly makes the same information testable.
