"""Turkish transliteration checked against the description the rules cite.

Every expectation here is a value Zimmer & Orgun print, with the page it
appears on. Where our output differs, it differs by a deviation the rule
file declares, and that deviation is applied to the published form
explicitly rather than being absorbed into a hand-edited expectation. A
reader can therefore see both what the source says and what this project
does about it.

The keyword lists are the right instrument for this. A passage
transcription records one speaker's performance, including variation and
error, which a deterministic rule set can neither reproduce nor should
try to. The keyword lists are statements about the mapping itself.
